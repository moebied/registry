This project is a python based web-application. In order to access and operate the website, first change into the directory using:

"cd ~/workspace/finalproject/"

Next, execute "flask run" in the terminal window. Click on generated link which utilizes a local server to host the website.

This will open the home page of the website in a new link, allowing full website usage. In order to access the additional features,
click the "Register" button in the top right corner. This will redirect to a registration page, which allows you to first select the
"user type". Our focus for this project was on developing full functionality for the "physician" user type, and so in order to explore
all the available features, it is best to register as a physician.

Once registration is complete, you should be logged into your newly created profile. The next step is to then click "New Record",
creating a new patient record and filling in the necessary information. This will then allow you to see the funcitonality of many of
the other areas, including "patients", "data" and others. Once hospitals and industry suppliers have registered profiles, these tabs
will become populated too.

Now just click around and have fun.
